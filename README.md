# Image processing: russian plate number

- This repo including some image processing.
- Russians are famous for having some of the most entertaining DashCam footage on the internet (I encourage you to Google Search "Russian DashCam").
  Unfortunately a lot of the footage contains license plates, perhaps we could help out and create a license plat blurring tool?

- OpenCV comes with a Russian license plate detector .xml file that we can use like we used the face detection files (unfortunately, it does not come with license detectors for other countries!)

# Project stages

- First- upload the image and the file.xml

- Second- draw a rectangle that detect the russian_plate_number
